# uniLUNG Reproducibility
This repository contains codes to reproduce the results published in the paper:

"A universal single-cell transcriptomics atlas of human lung decodes multiple pulmonary diseases"

The web portal of uniLUNG together with all the datasets are publicly available at https://lung.unifiedcellatlas.org.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `core_benchmark_annotation`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the data integrateion benchmark and cell type annotation for uniLUNG core.

- `multiple-diseases_analysis`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the healthy and multiple lung diseases analysis.

- `lung_cancer_sc`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the single-cell transcriptome analysis of lung cancer.

- `lung_cancer_sp`: This folder contains scripts that cover all the code related to the spatial transcriptome analysis of lung cancer.


## Issues
If you encounter any issues or have questions about the code or analysis, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact me via wufj5@mail2.sysu.edu.cn.
